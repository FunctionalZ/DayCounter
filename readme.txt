This is a very simple comand line program written in C by FunctZii (twitch.tv/functzii)
It counts the number of seconds over the course of aproximately one day
Before counting down for 5 seconds and closing
you can compile this using the GCC compiler in comand prompt use the following command when set to the source folder

gcc DayCounter.c -lwinmm

The precompiled binary is included in this source
I don't really care if you do anything with this program since it in all honesty is pretty useless outside of telling you that a day has passed
if you for some reason use it and want to credit me just put the repository link or plug the above twitch account.
